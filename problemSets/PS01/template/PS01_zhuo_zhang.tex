	\section*{Question 1 (40 points): Education}

A school counselor was curious about the average of IQ of the students in her school and took a random sample of 25 students' IQ scores. The following is the data set:\\
\vspace{.5cm}


\begin{enumerate}
	\item Find a 90\% confidence interval for the average student IQ in the school.\\
	  \lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=4, lastline=12]{PS01_zhuo_zhang.R}
	  \begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Result}:\\
		 1. 90\% Confidence Interval for School Students' Average IQ:\\
		 93.95993 - 102.9201\\
		
       \end{itemize}
	\item Next, the school counselor was curious  whether  the average student IQ in her school is higher than the average IQ score (100) among all the schools in the country.\\ 
	\noindent Using the same sample, conduct the appropriate hypothesis test with$\alpha=0.05$.

		\begin{itemize}
	      \item \textbf{Result:}\\
		  2.Hypothesis Test Results:\\
		  Test Statistic (t): -0.5957439\\ 
		  p-value: 0.7215383 \\
		  Null hypothesis not rejected: There is insufficient evidence that the average IQ of students in the school is above 100.

	\section*{Question 2 (40 points): Political Economy}

\noindent Researchers are curious about what affects the amount of money communities spend on addressing homelessness. The following variables constitute our data set about social welfare expenditures in the USA. \\
\vspace{.5cm}


\begin{tabular}{r|l}
	\texttt{State} &\emph{50 states in US} \\
	\texttt{Y} & \emph{per capita expenditure on shelters/housing assistance in state}\\
	\texttt{X1} &\emph{per capita personal income in state} \\
	\texttt{X2} &  \emph{Number of residents per 100,000 that are "financially insecure" in state}\\
	\texttt{X3} &  \emph{Number of people per thousand residing in urban areas in state} \\
	\texttt{Region} &  \emph{1=Northeast, 2= North Central, 3= South, 4=West} \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{.5cm}
\noindent Explore the \texttt{expenditure} data set and import data into \texttt{R}.

\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=32, lastline=32]{PS01_zhuo_zhang.R}

\begin{itemize}

\item
Please plot the relationships among \emph{Y}, \emph{X1}, \emph{X2}, and \emph{X3}? What are the correlations among them (you just need to describe the graph and the relationships among them)?
\vspace{.5cm}
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=34, lastline=39]{PS01_zhuo_zhang.R} 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{1}
\end{figure}

		\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Result:}
	\item  As can be seen in the scatterplot matrix, the relationship between Y and X1 shows a positive correlation. This means that as personal income per person (X1) increases, there is a tendency for expenditures per person on housing assistance (Y) to increase as well.
	\item  The relationship between Y and X2 is less obvious, and the scatterplot distribution is relatively scattered, making it difficult to determine if there is a clear linear relationship.
	\item  The relationship between Y and X3 appears to be negative. This implies that as the proportion of the population living in urban areas (X3) increases, spending per person on housing assistance (Y) may decrease.
	\item  The relationship between X1 and X2 and X3 is difficult to determine intuitively.\\
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{2}
	\end{figure}
\end{itemize}
\item
Please plot the relationship between \emph{Y} and \emph{Region}? On average, which region has the highest per capita expenditure on housing assistance?
\vspace{.5cm}
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=43, lastline=47]{PS01_zhuo_zhang.R} 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{3}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Result:}
	\item  On average, region 4 has the highest per capita expenditure on housing assistance.
	\\

\end{itemize}
\item
Please plot the relationship between \emph{Y} and \emph{X1}? Describe this graph and the relationship. Reproduce the above graph including one more variable \emph{Region} and display different regions with different types of symbols and colors.

\item The x-axis represents per capita personal income (X1) in the state.
\item The y-axis represents per capita expenditure on shelters/housing assistance (Y) in the state.
\item Different colors and shapes are used to differentiate between regions (1 = Northeast, 2 = North Central, 3 = South, 4 = West). In the context of Region 3 (South), with its lower per capita income.
\begin{itemize}
	\item\textbf{ Result:}
	\item As we can see from the chart above, there is a positive relationship between per capita personal income (X1) and per capita housing/housing assistance expenditures (Y), with the higher the per capita personal income (X1), the higher the per capita housing/housing assistance expenditures (Y). The South region has the lowest per capita personal income (X1) and the lowest per capita housing/housing assistance expenditures (Y).
